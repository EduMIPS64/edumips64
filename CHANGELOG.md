  contribute.

### Fixed

### Added
- New PDF manual (andrea)
- Italian translation of the PDF manual (simona)
- #include command (mancausoft)
- .word64 directive (andrea)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in SYSCALL 5. (andrea)

## 0.3.6 (10/10/2006)
### Added
- Added the ability to mask synchronous exceptions and to make those
  exceptions stop the CPU (andrea)
- Appended three dots to those menu items that open new dialogs, according
  to a widespread convention (andrea)

## 0.3.5.2 (17/09/2006)
### Fixed
- Fixed applet behaviour. (andrea)
- Fixed Parser recognizing of TRAP 0 and SYSCALL 0 (andrea)

## 0.3.5.1 (17/09/2006)
### Added
- TRAP 0 is recognized as the end of the program, like SYSCALL 0 and HALT (andrea)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in labels handling: now only case insensitive labels are
  accepted (andrea)
- Fixed a bug in BitSet64 regarding bit alignment in unsigned bytes writing (andrea)

## 0.3.5 (17/09/2006)
### Fixed
- Fixed the Memory and SymbolTable interfaces. Now all memory accesses via
  labels are done through the SymbolTable, and memory accesses via address
  are done through Memory.
  This object contains instructions and memory elements.
  I've removed all the old get() and set() methods that accepted an index in
  SymbolTable and MemoryElement. Now every access must be done using the
  address as a parameter. (andrea)
- Fixed the "package" ant task, that builds automagically a .jar and a
  .tar.bz2 file from the edumips64 directory (andrea)

## 0.3.4 (17/09/2006)
### Added
- command line options (andrea):
  -h (--help)         shows a little help
  -f (--file) filename    opens a new file
  -d (--debug)         enters debug mode
- SYSCALL 1, 2, 3, 4 implemented!
  They are the EduMIPS64 equivalent of the open(), close(), read() and write()
  POSIX syscalls. More documentation will follow (andrea).
- Makefile updated with the I/O icon (mancausoft)
- The parser now recognizes SYSCALL 0 as HALT, and it doesn't complain if a
  SYSCALL 0 closes the program (mancausoft)

### Changed
- The HALT instruction is added to the list of deprecated instruction (mancausoft)

## 0.3.3 (09/09/2006)
### Added
- The SYSCALL instruction is born! Right now only SYSCALL 0 and 5 work:
  . SYSCALL 0: acts exactly like the HALT instruction. [exit()]
  . SYSCALL 5: roughly acts like printf(), supporting only the following
  placeholders: %s (string), %d (integer), %i (same as %d), %% (literal %)
  SYSCALL works like WinDLX's SYSCALL: it expects in R14 the address of its
  parameters and places the return value in R1. SYSCALL 0 doesn't return
  anything, but SYSCALL 5 returns the number of bytes written to STDOUT.
  SYSCALL 5 is Dinero-friendly: it records every memory access it does in
  the tracefile. More documentation will follow. (andrea)
- New TRAP instruction, alias of SYSCALL, added for the sake of
  compatibility with WinDLX. (andrea)
- .ascii and .asciiz parser directives, used to save strings in memory.
  .ascii saves it in memory "as is", while .asciiz automatically adds a null
  byte at the end of the string. The backslash character is used to escape
  special characters (\n, \t, \0, \"). Here's the syntax:
  .ascii "string1"[, "string2"[, "stringN"]]
- Added the BREAK instruction, that stops the execution as soon as it enters
  in the ID stage. (andrea)
- Basic I/O window, that automagically pops up when something is written to STDOUT (andrea)
- Made the Settings menu item gray when the CPU is running a program, to
  prevent race conditions on the configuration settings (andrea).
- Added the version number to the statusbar welcome message (andrea)
- Added the right locale entries for the log window's title. (andrea)
- The .space instruction now accepts an hexadecimal parameter too. (andrea)
- Parser code improvements and cleanups (mancausoft + andrea)

### Fixed
- Corrected a bug that made fatal errors send the CPU in an infinite loop.
  At least, now we can read the log when there's a fatal error. (andrea)
- Solved a little bug that caused the cycles number not to reset correctly (andrea)

## 0.3.2 (08/09/2006)
### Added
- New .space directive, that allows to reserve some space in memory. It
  takes as a parameter an integer indicating the number of bytes to reserve. (andrea)
- Added a log window, that tracks the execution of EduMIPS64. Messages can
  be printed via the ui.GUILog methods, called on the static Main.logger
  object (andrea)
- Ant buildfile added. On my PC, make achieved a 22 seconds build time,
  while Ant achieved a 4 seconds build time, due to its ability to consider
  dependencies. Some targets are not ready, but jarfile is built by simply
  executing "ant". (andrea)
- Advanced frames handling (improved tiling algorithm, ability to hide/unhide
  windows from menu) (andrea)

### Changed
- The "Execute" and the "Tools" menu now become gray if all the inner items
  are not available (andrea)
- Log window icon (vanni)
- CPUGUIThread now doesn't wait for the sleep interval to pass when a single
  step is issued (andrea)

### Fixed
- Integer overflow and division by zero exception handling.
  The execution is stopped if one of these exceptions is raised. This solved
  a previously unknown bug: after an integer overflow, EduMIPS64 entered in
  an infinite loop. Now it works (andrea)
- Removed a debug print in CPUGUIThread (andrea)
- Added Vanni in the Main class copyrights, because a significant portion of
  that class' code is written by him (andrea)

## 0.3.1 (03/09/2006)
### Added
- Added the ability to customize the delay between cycles in verbose mode (andrea)
- The jar file can be used as an applet (vanni)

### Fixed
- JDialog + XGl fix (mancausoft + andrea)
- JApplet + XGl fix (mancausoft)

## 0.3 (23/07/2006)
### Added
- Added a progress bar that warns the user that the CPU is executing
  something (andrea)
- Added an option that allows the user to choose if he wants to see the
  progress of the multi-step execution via GUI or not. (andrea)
  - Handled the FileNotFoundException exception in the Main class. (andrea)
- In DineroFrontend, dineroIV is invoked if you press Enter when you are in
  the parameters textfield. (andrea)

### Changed
- Updated the manual according to the last changes. (andrea)

## 0.2.9 (22/07/2006)
### Added
- Created a thread that controls the CPU and the GUI. (antonella e andrea)
- Stop menu item, used to stop the execution at any time. (antonella e
  andrea)
- Minor changes to the GUI code in order to support multi-threading. (andrea)
- Internal code fixes: implemented a real state machine for the CPU and the
  GUI menu items that are enabled/disabled. For info about the four states,
  see the CPU.java documentation and source code. (andrea)

### Fixed
