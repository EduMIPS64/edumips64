## Learnings

### Classic JSX Runtime Requirement (2026-06-05)

EduMIPS64 uses the **classic JSX runtime** (@babel/preset-react WITHOUT runtime:automatic). Every `src/webapp` React component MUST keep `import React` in scope, even if no JSX appears to reference React directly. Removing it compiles and builds successfully but crashes at runtime with "React is not defined", causing the entire Playwright test suite to fail. ESLint rules suggesting removal of unused imports must be reviewed manually before committing React component files. The JSX transformer needs React in scope regardless of visibility in the source code.
