## Learnings — 2026-06-07: Build identity in user manual & web promotion docs

### common_conf.py fallback chain (docs/user/common_conf.py)
Replaced the fragile `open('../../../../gradle.properties')` (cwd-relative) with a five-step fallback:
1. `EDUMIPS64_BUILD_VERSION` env var (explicit override, highest priority).
2. `git describe --tags --match v* --always --dirty`, run via `git -C <repo_root>` where `<repo_root>` is resolved from `os.path.abspath(__file__)` — works regardless of the working directory (RTD, local, Gradle subproject invocations).  Leading `v` stripped.
3. `READTHEDOCS_GIT_COMMIT_HASH` shortened to 8 chars (RTD shallow-clone fallback when git tags aren't available).
4. `gradle.properties` `version=` line, resolved via `__file__` (not cwd) — fixes the existing fragility.
5. `"unknown"` as final fallback.
Each step is wrapped in `try/except` so any failure falls through silently.

### Files changed
- `docs/user/common_conf.py` — robust fallback chain for `version`/`release`.
- `docs/user/en/src/index.rst` — "This manual was generated for EduMIPS64 build |version|."
- `docs/user/it/src/index.rst` — "Questo manuale è stato generato per la build |version| di EduMIPS64."
- `docs/user/zh/src/index.rst` — "本手册是针对 EduMIPS64 构建版本 |version| 生成的。"
- `docs/developer-guide.md` — Added "Versioning model" and "Web production promotion" sections; updated CI workflows list to reflect `deploy-prod` disabled, nightly workflow added.

### Where developer docs live
Developer guide: `docs/developer-guide.md`. New sections inserted before "Manual release checklist", with ToC entries at the top of the file. Versioning model explains the release-label/build-identity split; web promotion section covers `promote-web.yml`, `rollback-web.yml`, `nightly-web.yml`, and the Pages layout (root / prev / v/N / nightly).

### Pre-existing note
The `latex_preamble` in `common_conf.py` uses `\D` in a non-raw string (produces a `SyntaxWarning` in Python 3.12+). This is pre-existing and unrelated to this change — left untouched per minimal-change policy.


### New page: `versioning.rst`
Created `docs/user/{en,it,zh}/src/versioning.rst` and added `versioning` as
the fifth entry in the first (UI-independent) toctree block of each
`docs/user/{en,it,zh}/src/index.rst` (after `examples`).

### Content summary (for future reference)
The page covers three topics:
1. **Version string format** — plain release number (e.g. `1.4.1`) vs.
   between-release build (e.g. `1.4.0-74-geec1768`: release + number of
   changes + short unique identifier). No dev jargon.
2. **Where to find the version** — desktop: window title / Help→About;
   CLI: `--version` flag; web: About tab + toolbar "Web Version" label.
3. **Web build badges** — the key user-facing rule:
   - No badge → stable production (https://web.edumips.org).
   - `NIGHTLY` (orange) → rebuilt every night, newest features, may be unstable.
   - `PR #N` (yellow) → temporary preview for a pull request.
   - `dev` (blue) → local development build.

### Translation confidence
- IT: full Italian translation, high confidence — matches tone of existing IT pages.
- ZH: full Simplified Chinese translation using `unicodedata`-verified underlines;
  moderate confidence — technically accurate, may benefit from native-speaker review.

### CJK / full-width punctuation rST inline-markup rule
In reStructuredText, inline markup (`**bold**`, `` ``literal`` ``) must be bounded by whitespace or ASCII punctuation. CJK characters and full-width punctuation (e.g. `（`, `）`, `。`, `；`) do NOT satisfy this boundary rule, so adjacent markup is silently dropped (renders as literal `**`/backticks). Fix: insert `\ ` (backslash-space, produces no visible output) between the inline markup delimiter and the adjacent CJK/full-width character. For nested or spanning bold+literal, split into separate non-nested markup runs joined with `\ ` — e.g. `**text；**\ ``NIGHTLY``\ **→ more text。**`.

## Learnings — 2026-06-08: Unified build+promote workflow with optional run_id

### Design change: `promote-web.yml` now unified

The `promote-web.yml` workflow has been refactored to consolidate "manual build" + "manual promote" into ONE workflow with an optional `run_id` input:
- **No `run_id`** (empty): Build current master from scratch (via reusable `build-web.yml`, no secrets) and promote it. One-click "ship current master" mode.
- **`run_id` provided**: Skip build; validate and promote that specific CI run. Enables rollback, re-promote, and promoting an arbitrary validated run.

Both modes:
- Dispatch from `master` only.
- Gated to `lupino3` (Andrea).
- Promote job serialised via concurrency `web-pages-deploy` (cancel-in-progress false).
- Build job (fresh mode) is not serialised.

### Files updated

- **`docs/design/web-promotion-and-versioning.md`**:
  - Section "Manual Gated Promotion" (lines 43–65): Expanded to describe both modes, inputs, dispatch requirement, and concurrency.
  - Section "Alternatives Considered" → "Promotion Trigger" (lines 174–181): Added rows (D) "Hard build+promote, dropping run_id" and (E) "Separate build→promote orchestrator" with rationales for rejection.
  - Section "Resolved Decisions" (line 251): Updated row 8 (workflow naming) to clarify that `promote-web.yml` unifies both modes.

- **`docs/developer-guide.md`**:
  - Section "Web production promotion" (lines 446–489): Restructured to clearly present two modes (Mode 1: empty `run_id` for build+promote current master; Mode 2: provided `run_id` for rollback/re-promote/audit). Simplified the normal-case procedure (just leave `run_id` empty) while preserving documented rollback capability.

### Key design points preserved

- Security: `build-web.yml` has `contents: read` only; `PAT_WEBUI` credential lives only in promote job.
- Immutability: Build+promote of current master is immutable once dispatched; re-promoting with external `run_id` validates artifact exists before deploy.
- Audit trail: manifest.json records all deployments; promotion numbers are monotonic.


## Learnings — 2026-06-08: In-app version navigator documentation

### Version navigator feature (in-app browsing of previous versions)

Users can now browse and open previous released versions of the web UI from the Help → About tab. The navigator reads `/manifest.json` and displays a list of retained versions (up to 50) with dates, build identifiers, and promotion metadata. Clicking an older version opens it at `/v/<N>/` in a new tab. The feature is gated on a successfully-fetched valid manifest and a non-PR build (PR previews don't show the navigator).

Key implementation detail: **monotonic version numbering** fixes a latent bug where a promote after a rollback could re-use and mutate an existing immutable snapshot. The deploy script maintains a `next_version` counter to ensure `n` is always `max(ever used) + 1`.

### Files changed

- `docs/user/en/src/versioning.rst` — Added "Viewing previous versions" subsection explaining the feature in simple user terms.
- `docs/user/it/src/versioning.rst` — Italian translation.
- `docs/user/zh/src/versioning.rst` — Simplified Chinese translation.
- `docs/developer-guide.md` — Added "Manifest and version history" and "Monotonic version numbering" subsections under "Web production promotion" section, documenting the `manifest.json` `history` array schema, the About-tab navigator behavior, gating conditions, backfill logic, prune-in-lockstep behavior, and the monotonic-numbering fix.
- `docs/design/web-promotion-and-versioning.md` — Added new "In-app Previous-Version Navigator" decision section describing the implementation, rejected alternatives (per-snapshot manifest.json and UI-only blind enumeration), and the monotonic-numbering fix. Added row 11 to "Resolved Decisions" table.

### Translation notes

- **IT:** Full Italian translation, high confidence — technically accurate and matches tone of existing IT pages.
- **ZH:** Full Simplified Chinese translation; technically accurate but may benefit from native-speaker review for phrasing naturalness.
