EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and graphical debugger.

## Notes for this release

This is version 1.2.10 of EduMIPS64. Its codename is FP - Freedom and Peace, because
of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which is being invaded by Russia. Freedom and Peace
is what I wish right now to the Ukrainians.
