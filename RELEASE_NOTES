                           EduMIPS64 RELEASE NOTES	
                           http://www.edumips.org

EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is version 1.2.5 of EduMIPS64, a bug-fix release that follows up on
version 1.2.4, that was released in December 2017. The codename for this
release is "Eden", as an homage to The Binding of Isaac, and also because
gardening is nice.

This release fixes issues with the cycles counter, which has always been
off-by-one, improves the UI for large programs, fixes the parsing of
load/store instructions' offsets and improves the handling of settings.

There is also a small new feature: the current CPU state is displayed in the
status bar.

A large change for developers is the migration to Bazel (http://bazel.io),
which is now the only build system used by EduMIPS64 (superseding both Gradle
and Ant).

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
PARTNER. :)

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.
