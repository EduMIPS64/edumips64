                           EduMIPS64 RELEASE NOTES	
                           http://www.edumips.org

EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is version 1.1 of EduMIPS64, a bug-fix release that follows up on
version 1.0, that was released almost 4 months ago. The codename for this
release is "Charleroi", since a good part of the code has been written in the
Charleroi airport, in Belgium.

The main areas of improvement for this version are correctness, internal
cleanliness and packageability.

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)

If you find a bug, please send us a bug report to bugs@edumips.org or open an
issue on GitHub.

If you use the simulator, please consider subscribing to the low-traffic
mailing-list edumips64-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, and help us by giving us
suggestions and sending bug reports. Thanks!

EduMIPS64 is hosted on GitHub (www.github.com/lupino3/edumips64), and we have
a git mirror (that lags a bit) on Google Code
(http://code.google.com/p/edumips64/). Our web site is www.edumips.org and we
still use it to communicate with our users. Releases are done on Sourceforge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/edumips64) and we also have a development
blog on http://edumips64.blogspot.com.
