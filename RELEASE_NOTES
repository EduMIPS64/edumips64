                           EduMIPS64 RELEASE NOTES	
                           http://www.edumips.org

EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is version 1.2.4 of EduMIPS64, a bug-fix release that follows up on
version 1.2.3, that was released in May 2017. The codename for this
release is "Nicolosi", last name of a dear friend that left us this year, in
the same spirit of the previous version.

This release introduces some more performance improvements for large programs
(thousands of instructions) and the ability to set the font size, useful for
high-resolution displays (e.g., 4k displays).

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.

  window (Issue #148)

- Improved modularity by removing unnecessary cross-module dependencies.
- Poor UI behavior with dual monitors (Issue #162)
