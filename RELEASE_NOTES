                           EduMIPS64 RELEASE NOTES	
                           http://www.edumips.org

EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is version 1.2.3 of EduMIPS64, a bug-fix release that follows up on
version 1.2.1, that was released in June 2016. The codename for this
release is "Angelo", to honor a dear friend who recently left us.

This release introduces performance improvements for large programs (thousands
of instructions), a few bug fixes, code quality improvements thanks to
Codacity analysis and improved test coverage.

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.

EduMIPS64 is hosted on GitHub: www.github.com/lupino3/edumips64.

New in this release since version 1.2.2

Added
~~~~~
- Compiled the core to JavaScript. It's possible to run the EduMIPS64 core
  in the browser! A very simplistic prototype is available at 
  www.edumips.org/edumips64.html.
- Developer guide, with documentation useful for developers that want to
  contribute.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Values that exceed data types' limits are silently discarded in .data (Issue
  #1)
- Parsing an invalid double should raise IrregularStringOfBitsException (Issue
  #77)
- Lots of code quality fixes, thanks to the Codacity analysis
- Added more unit tests (including, but not limited to, FPU, SYSCALL and
  out-of-order execution. Started tracking and improving code coverage
- Fixed a flaky unit test (#125)
- Added typed configuration keys (#130)
- Removed all uses of the Singleton design pattern (Issue #83)
- CRLF bug on windows (Issue #95)
- The code size should not take into account BUBBLE instructions (Issue #84)
- Better dependency handling (Issue #74)
- Fixed handling of the %% placeholder in the parser
- Fix no-GUI execution (#133) - the GUI is correctly not updated if the "sync"
  option is disabled.
- Fix CycleBuilder bug when the same instruction is in the pipeline multiple
  times (#139)
- Sped up CycleBuilder logic a lot, addressing the non-UI root cause of #132
