				     EduMIPS64 RELEASE NOTES	
				     http://www.edumips.org

EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is version 0.5 of EduMIPS64. Many bug fixes occurred since version 0.4, but
the most significant improvement is the implementation of a big subset of the
MIPS32 ISA that is contained in the MIPS64 ISA.

EduMIPS64 0.5 is far stabler than 0.4, and the new instructions have been tested
and should work correctly.

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)
