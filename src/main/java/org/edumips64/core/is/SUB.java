/**<pre>
 *      Syntax: SUB rd, rs, rt
 * Description: To subtract 32-bit integers; trap on overflow
 *               The 32-bit word value in GPR rt is subtracted from
 *              the 32-bit value in GPR rs to produce a 32-bit result.
 *    If it does not overflow, the 32-bit result is sign-extended and placed into GPR rd.
