/**
 * <pre>
 *      Syntax: DSLLV rd, rt, rs
 * Description: To execute a left-shift of a doubleword by a variable number of bits.
 *              The 64-bit doubleword contents of GPR rt are shifted left, inserting
 *              zeros into the emptied bits. The bit-shift amount in the range 0 to 63 is specified by the low-order 6 bits in GPR rs.
 *         The result is placed in GPR rd.
