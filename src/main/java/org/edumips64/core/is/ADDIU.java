/**
 * <pre>
 *        Syntax: ADDIU rt, rs, immediate
 *   Description: To add a constant to a 32-bit integer
 *                The 16-bit signed immediate is added to the 32-bit value
 *                in GPR rs and the 32-bit arithmetic result is sign extended and placed into
 *                GPR rt. No Integer Overflow exception occurs under any circumstances.
