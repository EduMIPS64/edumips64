/**
 * <pre>
 *      Syntax: SLTIU rt, rs, immediate
 * Description: Records the result of an unsigned less-than comparison with a constant
 *          comparing the contents of GPR rs and the sign-extended immediate as unsigned
 *              and recording the result in GPR rt. If GPR rs is less than immediate, rt
 *    will be 1 i.e true, else rt will be 0 i.e false.
