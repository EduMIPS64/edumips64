 * <pre>
 *        Syntax: DADDIU rt, rs, immediate
 *   Description: To add a constant to a 64-bit integer
 *                The 16-bit signed immediate is added to the 64-bit value
 *                in GPR rs and the 64-bit arithmetic result is placed into
 *                GPR rt. No Integer Overflow exception occurs under any circumstances.
