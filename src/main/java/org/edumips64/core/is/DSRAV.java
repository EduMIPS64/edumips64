/**
 * <pre>
 *      Format: DSRAV rd, rt, rs
 * Description: To execute an arithmetic right-shift of a doubleword by a variable number of bits
 * Description: rd = rt >> rs (arithmetic)
 *  The doubleword contents of GPR rt are shifted right, duplicating
 *  the sign bit (63) into the emptied bits. The bit-shift amount in the range 0 to 63 is specified by the low-order 6 bits in GPR rs.
 *  The result is placed in GPR rd.
