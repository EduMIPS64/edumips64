 * <pre>
 *          Syntax: DADDU rd, rs, rt
 *     Description: rd = rs + rt
 *                  To add 64-bit integers
 *        The 64-bit doubleword value in GPR rt is added to the 64-bit value
 *        in GPR rs and the 64-bit arithmetic result is placed into GPR rd.
 *        No Integer Overflow exception occurs under any circumstances.
