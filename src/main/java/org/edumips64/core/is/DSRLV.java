/**
 * <pre>
 * Syntax:      DSRLV rd, rt, rs
 * Description: To execute a logical right-shift of a doubleword by a variable number of bits
 *  The 64-bit doubleword contents of GPR rt are shifted right, inserting
 *  zeros into the emptied bits. The bit-shift amount in the range 0 to 63 is specified by the low-order 6 bits in GPR rs.
* The result is placed in GPR rd.
