The instruction set
===================

In this section we will the subset of the MIPS64 instruction set that EduMIPS64
recognizes. We can operate two different taxonomic classification: one based on
the functionality of the instructions and one based on the type of the
parameters of the instructions. 

.. Please refer to Section~\ref{mipsis} for more informations about those classifications.

The first classification divides instruction into three categories:
ALU instructions, Load/Store instructions, Flow control instructions. The next
three subsections will describe each category and every instruction that belongs
to those categories.

The fourth subsection will describe instructions that do not fit in any of the
three categories.

.. For a more complete MIPS64 instruction set reference, please refer to~\cite{mips-2}.


ALU Instructions
----------------
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (in short, ALU) is a part of the execution unit of a
CPU, that has the duty of doing arithmetical and logic operations. So in the ALU
instructions group we will find those instructions that do this kind of
operations.

ALU Instructions can be divided in two groups: *R-Type* and *I-Type*. 

Four of those instructions make use of two special registers: LO and HI. They
are internal CPU registers, whose value can be accessed through the
`MFLO` and `MFHI` instructions.

Load/Store instructions
-----------------------
This category contains all the instructions that operate transfers between
registers and the memory. All of these instructions are in the form::
  [label:] instruction rt, offset(base)

Where rt is the source or destination register, depending if we are using a
store or a load instruction; offset is a label or an immediate value and base is
a register. The address is obtained by adding to the value of the register
`base` the immediate value `offset`.

The address specified must be aligned according to the data type that is
treated. Load instructions ending with "U" treat the content of the register
rt as an unsigned value.

List of load instructions:

* `LB rt, offset(base)`

  Loads the content of the memory cell at address specified by offset and base in register rt, treating it as a signed byte.

* `LBU rt, offset(base)`

  Loads the content of the memory cell at address specified by offset and base in register rt, treating it as an unsigned byte.

* `LD rt, offset(base)`

  Loads the content of the memory cell at address specified by offset and base in register rt, treating it as a double word.

* `LH rt, offset(base)`

  Loads the content of the memory cell at address specified by offset and base in register rt, treating it as a signed half word.

* `LHU rt, offset(base)`

  Loads the content of the memory cell at address specified by offset and base in register rt, treating it as an unsigned half word.

* `LW rt, offset(base)`

  Loads the content of the memory cell at address specified by offset and base in register rt, treating it as a signed word.

* `LWU rt, offset(base)`

  Loads the content of the memory cell at address specified by offset and base in register rt, treating it as a signed word.

List of store instructions:

* `SD rt, offset(base)`

  Stores the content of register rt in the memory cell specified by offset and base, treating it as a double word.

* `SH rt, offset(base)`

  Stores the content of register rt in the memory cell specified by offset and base, treating it as a half word.

* `SW rt, offset(base)`

  Stores the content of register rt in the memory cell specified by offset and base, treating it as a word.

Flow control instructions
-------------------------
Flow control instructions are used to alter the order of instructions that are
fetched by the CPU. We can make a distinction between these instructions:
R-Type, I-Type and J-Type.

Those instructions effectively executes the jump in the ID stage, so often an
useless fetch is executed. In this case, two instructions are removed from the
pipeline, and the branch taken stalls counter is incremented by two units.

List of R-Type flow control instructions:

* `JALR rs`

  Puts the content of rs into the program counter, and puts into R31 the address of the instruction that follows the JALR instruction, the return value.

* `JR rs`

  Puts the content of rs into the program counter.

List of I-Type flow control instructions:

* `B offset`

  Unconditionally jumps to offset

* `BEQ rs, rt, offset`

  Jumps to offset if rs is equal to rt.

* `BEQZ rs, offset`

  Jumps to offset if rs is equal to zero.

..	\WARN

* `BGEZ rs, offset`

  If rs is greather than zero, does a PC-relative jump to offset.

* `BNE rs, rt, offset`

  Jumps to offset if rs is not equal to rt.

* `BNEZ rs, offset`

  Jumps to offset if rs is not equal to zero.

..	\WARN

List of J-Type flow control instructions:

* `J target`

  Puts the immediate value target into the program counter.

* `JAL target`

  Puts the immediate value target into the program counter, and puts into R31 the address of the instruction that follows the JAL instruction, the return value.

The `SYSCALL` instruction
-------------------------
The SYSCALL instruction offers to the programmer an operating-system-like
interface, making available six different system calls.

System calls expect that the address of their parameters is stored in register
R14 ($t6), and will put their return value in register R1 ($at).

System calls follow as much as possible the POSIX convention.

`SYSCALL 0 - exit()`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SYSCALL 0 does not expect any parameter, nor it returns anything. It simply stops
the simulator.

Note that if the simulator does not find SYSCALL 0 in the source code, or any of
its equivalents (HALT - TRAP 0), it will be added automatically at the end of
the source.

`SYSCALL 1 - open()`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SYSCALL 1 expects two parameters: a zero-terminated string that indicates
the pathname of the file that must be opened, and a double word containing an
integer that indicates the flags that must be used to specify how to open the
file.

This integer must be built summing the flags that you want to use, choosing them
from the following list:

* `O_RDONLY (0x01)` Opens the file in read only mode;
* `O_WRONLY (0x02)` Opens the file in write only mode;
* `O_RDWR (0x03)` Opens the file in read/write mode;
* `O_CREAT (0x04)` Creates the file if it does not exist;
* `O_APPEND (0x08)` In write mode, appends written text at the end of the file;
* `O_TRUNC (0x08)` In write mode, deletes the content of the file as soon as it is opened.

It is mandatory to specify one of the first three modes. The fourth and the
fifth modes are exclusive, you can not specify O_APPEND if you specify O_TRUNC
(and vice versa). 

You can specify a combination of modes by simply adding the integer values of
those flags. For instance, if you want to open a file in write only mode and
append the written text to the end of file, you should specify the mode 2 + 8 = 10.

The return value of the system call is the new file descriptor associated with
the file, that can be further used with the other system calls. If there is an
error, the return value will be -1.

`SYSCALL 2 - close()`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SYSCALL 2 expects only one parameter, the file descriptor of the file that is
closed.

If the operation ends successfully, SYSCALL 2 will return 0, otherwise it will
return -1. Possible causes of failure are the attempt to close a non-existent
file descriptor or the attempt to close file descriptors 0, 1 or 2, that are
associated respectively to standard input, standard output and standard error.

`SYSCALL 3 - read()`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SYSCALL 3 expects three parameters: the file descriptor to read from, the
address where the read data must be put into, the number of bytes to read.

If the first parameter is 0, the simulator will prompt the user for an input,
via an input dialog. If the length of the input is greater than the number of
bytes that have to be read, the simulator will show again the message dialog.

It returns the number of bytes that have effectively been read, or -1 if the
read operation fails. Possible causes of failure are the attempt to read from a
non-existent file descriptor, the attempt to read from file descriptors 1
(standard output) or 2 (standard error) or the attempt to read from a write-only
file descriptor.

`SYSCALL 4 - write()`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SYSCALL 4 expects three parameters: the file descriptor to write to, the address
where the data must be read from, the number of bytes to write.

If the first parameter is two or three, the simulator will pop the input/output
frame, and write there the read data.

It returns the number of bytes that have been written, or -1 if the write
operation fails. Possible causes of failure are the attempt to write to a
non-existent file descriptor, the attempt to write to file descriptor 0
(standard input) or the attempt to write to a read-only file descriptor.

`SYSCALL 5 - printf()`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SYSCALL 5 expects a variable number of parameters, the first being the address
of the so-called "format string". In the format string can be included some
placeholders, described in the following list:
* `%s` indicates a string parameter;
* `%i` indicates an integer parameter;
* `%d` behaves like `%i`;
* `%%` literal `%`

For each `%s`, `%d` or `%i` placeholder, SYSCALL 5 expects a parameter,
starting from the address of the previous one.

When the SYSCALL finds a placeholder for an integer parameter, it expects that
the corresponding parameter is an integer value, when if it finds a placeholder
for a string parameter, it expects as a parameter the address of the string.

The result is printed in the input/output frame, and the number of bytes
written is put into R1.

If there's an error, -1 is written to R1.

Other instructions
------------------
In this section there are instructions that do not fit in the previous 
categories.

`BREAK`
~~~~~~~
The BREAK instruction throws an exception that has the effect to stop the
execution if the simulator is running. It can be used for debugging purposes.

`NOP`
~~~~~
The NOP instruction does not do anything, and it's used to create gaps in the
source code.

`TRAP`
~~~~~~
The TRAP instruction is a deprecated alias for the SYSCALL instruction.

`HALT`
~~~~~~
The HALT instruction is a deprecated alias for the SYSCALL 0 instruction, that
halts the simulator.
