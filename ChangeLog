EduMIPS64 ChangeLog
------------------- 

0.4   (18/03/2007)
	- New PDF manual (andrea)
	- Italian translation of the PDF manual (simona)
	- Fixed a bug in SYSCALL 5. (andrea)
	- #include command (mancausoft)
	- .word64 directive (andrea)

0.3.6 (10/10/2006)
	- Added the ability to mask synchronous exceptions and to make those
	  exceptions stop the CPU (andrea)
	- Appended three dots to those menu items that open new dialogs, according
	  to a widespread convention (andrea)
	- Removed an useless debug print in the BREAK instruction (andrea)
	- Changed the "Run to" text to "Run", the "Completa" text to "Esegui". and
	  the "Esegui" menu text to "Esecuzione (andrea)

0.3.5.2 (17/09/2006)
	- Fixed applet behaviour. (andrea)
	- Fixed Parser recognizing of TRAP 0 and SYSCALL 0 (andrea)

0.3.5.1 (17/09/2006)
	- Fixed a bug in labels handling: now only case insensitive labels are
	  accepted (andrea)
	- Fixed a bug in BitSet64 regarding bit alignment in unsigned bytes writing (andrea)
	- TRAP 0 is recognized as the end of the program, like SYSCALL 0 and HALT (andrea)

0.3.5 (17/09/2006)
	- Fixed the Memory and SymbolTable interfaces. Now all memory accesses via
	  labels are done through the SymbolTable, and memory accesses via address
	  are done through Memory.
	  This object contains instructions and memory elements.
	  I've removed all the old get() and set() methods that accepted an index in
	  SymbolTable and MemoryElement. Now every access must be done using the
	  address as a parameter. (andrea)
	- Fixed the "package" ant task, that builds automagically a .jar and a
	  .tar.bz2 file from the edumips64 directory (andrea)

0.3.4 (17/09/2006)
	- Added command line options (andrea):
	  -h (--help) 				shows a little help
	  -f (--file) filename		opens a new file
	  -d (--debug) 				enters debug mode
	- SYSCALL 1, 2, 3, 4 implemented! 
	  They are the EduMIPS64 equivalent of the open(), close(), read() and write()
	  POSIX syscalls. More documentation will follow (andrea).
	- Makefile updated with the I/O icon (mancausoft)
	- The parser now recognizes SYSCALL 0 as HALT, and it doesn't complain if a
	  SYSCALL 0 closes the program (mancausoft)
	- The HALT instruction is added to the list of deprecated instruction (mancausoft)

0.3.3 (09/09/2006)
	- The SYSCALL instruction is born! Right now only SYSCALL 0 and 5 work: 
	  . SYSCALL 0: acts exactly like the HALT instruction. [exit()]
	  . SYSCALL 5: roughly acts like printf(), supporting only the following
		placeholders: %s (string), %d (integer), %i (same as %d), %% (literal %)
	  SYSCALL works like WinDLX's SYSCALL: it expects in R14 the address of its
	  parameters and places the return value in R1. SYSCALL 0 doesn't return
	  anything, but SYSCALL 5 returns the number of bytes written to STDOUT.
	  SYSCALL 5 is Dinero-friendly: it records every memory access it does in
	  the tracefile. More documentation will follow. (andrea)
	- New TRAP instruction, alias of SYSCALL, added for the sake of
	  compatibility with WinDLX. (andrea)
	- .ascii and .asciiz parser directives, used to save strings in memory.
	  .ascii saves it in memory "as is", while .asciiz automatically adds a null
	  byte at the end of the string. The backslash character is used to escape
	  special characters (\n, \t, \0, \"). Here's the syntax:
	  .ascii "string1"[, "string2"[, "stringN"]]
	- Added the BREAK instruction, that stops the execution as soon as it enters
	  in the ID stage. (andrea)
	- Basic I/O window, that automagically pops up when something is written to STDOUT (andrea)
	- Made the Settings menu item gray when the CPU is running a program, to
	  prevent race conditions on the configuration settings (andrea).
	- Solved a little bug that caused the cycles number not to reset correctly (andrea)
	- Added the version number to the statusbar welcome message (andrea)
	- Added the right locale entries for the log window's title. (andrea)
	- The .space instruction now accepts an hexadecimal parameter too. (andrea)
	- Parser code improvements and cleanups (mancausoft + andrea)
	- Corrected a bug that made fatal errors send the CPU in an infinite loop.
	  At least, now we can read the log when there's a fatal error. (andrea)
	
0.3.2 (08/09/2006)
	- Integer overflow and division by zero exception handling. 
	  The execution is stopped if one of these exceptions is raised. This solved
	  a previously unknown bug: after an integer overflow, EduMIPS64 entered in
	  an infinite loop. Now it works (andrea)
	- New .space directive, that allows to reserve some space in memory. It
	  takes as a parameter an integer indicating the number of bytes to reserve. (andrea)
	- Added a log window, that tracks the execution of EduMIPS64. Messages can
	  be printed via the ui.GUILog methods, called on the static Main.logger
	  object (andrea)
	- Ant buildfile added. On my PC, make achieved a 22 seconds build time,
	  while Ant achieved a 4 seconds build time, due to its ability to consider
	  dependencies. Some targets are not ready, but jarfile is built by simply
	  executing "ant". (andrea)
	- The "Execute" and the "Tools" menu now become gray if all the inner items
	  are not available (andrea)
	- Log window icon (vanni)
	- CPUGUIThread now doesn't wait for the sleep interval to pass when a single
	  step is issued (andrea)
	- Removed a debug print in CPUGUIThread (andrea)
	- Advanced frames handling (improved tiling algorithm, ability to hide/unhide
	  windows from menu) (andrea)
	- Added Vanni in the Main class copyrights, because a significant portion of
	  that class' code is written by him (andrea)

0.3.1 (03/09/2006)
	- Added the ability to customize the delay between cycles in verbose mode (andrea)
	- JDialog + XGl fix (mancausoft + andrea)
	- The jar file can be used as an applet (vanni)
	- JApplet + XGl fix (mancausoft)

  0.3 (23/07/2006) [Public Release]
    - Added a progress bar that warns the user that the CPU is executing
	  something (andrea)
	- Added an option that allows the user to choose if he wants to see the
	  progress of the multi-step execution via GUI or not. (andrea)
    - Handled the FileNotFoundException exception in the Main class. (andrea)
	- In DineroFrontend, dineroIV is invoked if you press Enter when you are in
	  the parameters textfield. (andrea)
	- Updated the manual according to the last changes. (andrea)

0.2.9 (22/07/2006)
	- Created a thread that controls the CPU and the GUI. (antonella e andrea)
	- Stop menu item, used to stop the execution at any time. (antonella e
      andrea)
	- Minor changes to the GUI code in order to support multi-threading. (andrea)
	- Internal code fixes: implemented a real state machine for the CPU and the
	  GUI menu items that are enabled/disabled. For info about the four states,
	  see the CPU.java documentation and source code. (andrea)
	- Minor documentation and code improvements (andrea)

 0.2 (26/06/2006) [Public Release]
	- Now in the titlebar there's the version number (andrea)
	- Fixed Dinero Frontend font that in some PCs wasn't monospaced. (andrea)
	- Changed DineroIV default options (andrea)
	- Fixed a DDIV bug: semaphores where wrongly decremented if there was a	
	  division by zero and forwarding was disabled (mancausoft)
	- Fixed a micro-bug in the translations (andrea)

0.1.5 (25/06/2006)
	- Updated the manual in order to include recent features. (andrea)
	- Removed accented letters from the italian version of the manual (ale)

	- Solved the "impossible focus" bug for each dialog. (andrea)
	- Fixed a little bug that made possible to select Dinero Frontend or Write
	  dinero tracefile if you opened a file after you completed the execution of
	  another file (andrea)
	- Fixed the "row selection" bug in the Registers frame: now you can interact
	  only with GPR registers, as FP registers don't exist. (vanni)
	- The status bar displays the decimal value of a register or of a memory
	  cell if you click on it (vanni) [I told you that the status bar would be useful.. :P]

	  automatically set to zero and a warning is shown (mancausoft)
	- Fixed a bug that crashed the parser if after a comma there
	  wasn't a parameter for the instruction (mancausoft)
	- Recent files list isn't allowed to hold multiple copies of a file (andrea)
	- Internationalization of the Manual window, plus adding version info from
	  the Main class (andrea)
	- Improved the look&feel of the Manual window (filippo)
	- Fixed a bug in the instruction set: the DMULT instruction was called DMUL (massimo)
	- Fixed a bug in the parser that made possible to open malformed asm files (mancausoft)
	- Little bugfix: if the opened file contains syntax errors, the window
	  title is correctly cleaned (andrea)
