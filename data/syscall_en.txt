SYSCALL INSTRUCTION
===================

The SYSCALL instruction offers to the programmer an operating-system-like
interface.
System calls expect that the address of their parameters is stored in register
R14, and will put their return value in register R1.
If an error occurs, they put the value -1 into R1 register.
The syscall 0 not returns anything.
